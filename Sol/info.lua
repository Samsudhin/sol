It has a diameter of about 1,392,000 km, about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass (about 2Ã—1030 kilograms, 330,000 times that of Earth) accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.

Chemically, about three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen, while the rest is mostly helium.
